# To-Do App

This is a simple yet powerful To-Do App built with React. The app allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently, providing features such as task creation, editing, deletion, and marking tasks as complete. The intuitive user interface is designed to enhance productivity by keeping the user focused on their tasks.

#### Features:
- **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new tasks with a clean and straightforward input form.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks that are no longer needed with a single click.
- **Task Completion:** Mark tasks as completed to keep track of progress.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across all devices.
- **Local Storage:** Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so users don't lose their data on page refresh.

#### Technologies Used:
- **React:** Utilized for building the user interface with reusable components and state management.
- **CSS:** Styled-components for a modular and maintainable design.
- **JavaScript:** Used for handling the app's logic and interactions.
- **LocalStorage API:** For persisting tasks even after closing the browser.

This project demonstrates the use of fundamental React concepts such as hooks, state management, and component-based architecture. It is a great example of building a real-world application using modern JavaScript practices.
